## GitLab is Overtaking GitHub

Due to recent acquisition of GitHub by Microsoft, many developers have been trying to find alternatives to the commonly used Git host. Some have noticed that Microsoft's vision often goes against end-user's needs and wants, instead focusing on the bottom line. With these fears growing, many other version control platforms have begun sprouting in the open-source space.
One of these platforms, GitLab, has been on the rise in recent months. With a recent influx of funding and huge interest garnered due to it's open-source nature, programmers began to feel more hope for a non-corporate, transparent platform for code-sharing and version control. This rise in indie development has been a trend recently in general, as many large companies including the big 4 want to control and shape the talent pipeline, being able to find and recruit programming talent in it's budding. Thankfully, the barrier of entry is getting lowered every year into the tech industry, hopefully increasing diversity in the future.
